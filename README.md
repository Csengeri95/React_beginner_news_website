# React beginner news website

In this project, I wanted to create a modern news portal where readers can find mainly political and cultural news. On the main page, you will find the main news at the top, with pictures and names of staff members at the bottom. Click on them to see all the articles written by that journalist. There are separate pages for political and cultural articles. Some readings can only be viewed in full if the reader is logged in, so I have also created a registration and login page linked to a MongoDb database. I used Node.js to manage the database.  I store the user data in LocalStorage. I created a search page where the user can search for a specific article. I practiced SEO in my project, so I tried to create this for all my pages.
